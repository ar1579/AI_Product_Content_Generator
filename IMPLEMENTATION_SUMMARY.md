## 🔴 CRITICAL SEVERITY FIXES (100% Complete)

### 1. ✅ Removed Hardcoded Credentials
**File:** `shopify.app.toml`

**Issue:** Client ID was hardcoded in the configuration file, exposing sensitive credentials.

**Fix:**
\`\`\`toml
# Before
client_id = "ab24c9a5bb076ec51481b7f0c2411911"
application_url = "https://example.com"

# After
client_id = "$SHOPIFY_API_KEY"
application_url = "$SHOPIFY_APP_URL"
\`\`\`

**Impact:** Eliminates security risk of exposed credentials in version control.

---

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Database Connection Handling
**File:** `app/db.server.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive error handling for database initialization
- Implemented connection testing on startup
- Added graceful shutdown handling

- Implemented database-backed caching with 7-day expiration
- Added proper indexing for performance
- Implemented cache invalidation logic
- Added unique constraints to prevent duplicates

**Benefits:**
- Content persists across server restarts
- Works correctly in multi-instance deployments
- Prevents memory leaks from unbounded cache growth
- Reduces OpenAI API costs through persistent caching

**New Database Schema:**
\`\`\`prisma
model GeneratedContent {
  id                    String   @id @default(uuid())
  shop                  String
  productId             String
  selectedVariant       String?
  title                 String
  productDescription    String
  // ... additional fields
  createdAt             DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt             DateTime @updatedAt
  expiresAt             DateTime

  @@unique([shop, productId, selectedVariant])
  @@index([shop])
  @@index([productId])
  @@index([expiresAt])
}
\`\`\`
